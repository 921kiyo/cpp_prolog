(a)
waiting -> godot.
tick /\ waiting -> waiting.
tick.

(b)      godot   1

       tick, waiting 3
           |
         waiting 4
           |           looping here.

(c) Prolog loops and does not return.

(d) decision procedure would return false (godot is not provable).

2.
(a)

even(z).
all x. even(x) -> odd(s(x)).
all x. odd(x) -> even(s(x)).

(b)
exists x.  odd(x) /\ even(x).

(c):  first and 3rd are models;  second is not: (s(s(z)) is even,
      s(s(s(z))) is not odd.

 (d):  not logical consequence since there is a model (M1) where
       it is false.

(e)   ~ exists x. odd(x) /\ even(x) not logical consequence, since
      it is false in M3 above.

(f)   exists x.odd(x) is logical consequence:
      Prolog shows odd(s(z)), Prolog proof is sound, ie proved statements
      are true in all models
